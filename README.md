## Migrating from "Posting Template"

This is an upgrade and rewrite of my ["Posting Template" extension](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/posting_template_4/).
It got renamed to "Topic Template" to reflect better what it does.

This extension checks in the install process if the "Posting Template" is enabled.
If this is the case, all data is migrated. All templates are copied to this extension.

In order to migrate the templates from "Posting Template":

* keep "Posting Template" enabled.
* Install and enable this extension.
* Disable "Posting Template".

## Quick Install

You can install this on the latest release of phpBB 3.2 by following the steps below:

* Create `marttiphpbb/topictemplate` in the `ext` directory.
* Download and unpack the repository into `ext/marttiphpbb/topictemplate`
* Enable `Posting Template` in the ACP at `Customise -> Manage extensions`.
* You can start editing the Topic Template in the Forum ACP for each Forum.

## Uninstall

* Disable `Topic Template` in the ACP at `Customise -> Extension Management -> Extensions`.
